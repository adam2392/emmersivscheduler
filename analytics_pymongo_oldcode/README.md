Using python, mongodb and pymongo, I am creating analytics that will be stored in a database. Then I will develop algorithms to provide 
high quality information to behavioral therapists. This is work done at the West Health Institute. 

Children will play games that are programmed on the Microsoft Kinect. These games are intended to provide behavioral therapy that can potentially
act as a remote/digital form of therapy that could lower the cost of Autism Spectrum Disorder. JSON data will be collected from
each gaming session that stores a variety of information from the game and the child. This data will be stored via documents and collections
on the MongoDB server. Then with python, this data will be analyzed to output analytics for ASD clinicians.
